## Alacritty and Neovim

Alacritty is a modern terminal emulator that provides a flexible set of features with high performance. 

Neovim is a project that seeks to aggressively refactor Vim, simplifying maintenance and encouraging contributions.

Here, you can find my configuration for both.

To use it, create symlinks in your home directory:

```
ln -s /path/to/repo/alacritty ~/.config/alacritty
ln -s /path/to/repo/fil_nvim ~/.config/nvim
ln -s /path/to/repo/sketchybar ~/.config/sketchybar
```
